    <h4>Here is a time of Mother Teresa</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mother Teresa grew famous for humbly ministering to lepers, the homeless and the poorest of the poor in the slums of Calcutta, India. She was procalimed a saint by the Catholic Church in 2016.</li>
            <li>She changed her name to Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa was dedicated to taking care of the poor and helping the needy and She devoted her life to taking care of the sick and anyone who needed love. ... Mother Teresa made a huge impact on the world we live in. In the 1950s, she began helping those with leprosy</li>
            <li>Saint Teresa of Calcutta (aka Mother Teresa) was a Catholic Sister. When she was a young woman she made lifelong promises of poverty, chastity, and obedience. She was never married, and could never marry due to her religious promises.</li>
            <li>She begged for food and supplies to help the poor. She also began teaching children how to care for themselves. Sister Teresa saw a need for children to be educated so she taught them lessons by writing in the dirt because they had no books and nothing to write with.</li>
            <li>The process of canonisation requires the documentation of a miracle resulting from the intercession of the prospective saint. In 2002 the Vatican recognised as a miracle the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of Monica Besra, an Indian woman, after the application of a locket containing Teresa's picture.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            Peace begins with a smile..
            Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.
            Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.
